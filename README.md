# ethical-keylogger

This project is a personal challenge to build a working Python-based keylogger from scratch.  
The goal is to simulate how real-world tools operate â€” for **research, red teaming, and defense training purposes only**.

Libraries to use :
- pynput : To listen pressed keyboard characters
- pyautogui : For capture screenshots every x time or if there will be matched keywords written.
- cryptography : To crypt the data (For now we will use symmetric encryption because of working locally, later to the project gonna be added C2 then we will change to asymetric)
- Fernet : We will use that for symmetric encryption
- requests



This software is for research and educational use only.
Do not deploy or distribute this without proper legal and ethical clearance.
