This project is a personal challenge to build a working Python-based keylogger from scratch.  
The goal is to simulate how real-world tools operate â€” for **research, red teaming, and defense training purposes only**.

Libraries to use :
- pynput : To listen pressed keyboard characters
- pyautogui
- cryptography
- requests



This software is for research and educational use only.
